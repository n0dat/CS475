1. A starts, and B goes next then A then B ...
	A -> B -> A -> B

2. Selects x where 1 <= x <= 9 if the number has not been selected before
	So no duplicates (if A chooses 1 on round 1 then 1 is no longer available to either A or B)

3. If the number in previous round x < 5 then the next x must be x >= 5

4. If x in previous round is odd ( x % 2 != 0) then the next number must be even (x % 2 == 0)
	So if A chooses 1 then B must choose an even number (2, 4, 6, 8)
		- But must follow rule 3.

So ... 
	If A chooses 1, B must choose from {6, 8}.
	 -> If B chooses 6, A must choose from {3, 5, 7, 9}
			This happens because x >= 5 does not have to follow rule 4 but must follow rule 3.
	 -> If A chooses 3, B must choose from {8}. This is because A chose an odd and only 1 even
			valure remains that has not been previously chosen.
		You could write the entire game tree for this problem.

5. The game ends when either A or B canoot select an number x to continue. 
	Who ever chose the last valid number wins the game.

6. The uitility at each state x is x for the winning player and -x for the losing one
	( if B cannot select a number to continue after A select 3 then the utility for A is 3 and B is -3 ).
 

Time to actually implemene this though.
